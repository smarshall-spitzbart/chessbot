# Image Processing System For Robotic Arm Playing Chess
Collaborated on a project enabling two separate robotic arms to autonomously play chess against one another. My image processing system is included within CorrectPosition.m, ProcessImageDisp.m, and ProcessImageRot.m. The remaining functions were written by other lab students.
