# Computer Vision System For Robotic Arm Playing Chess
Collaborated on a project enabling two separate robotic arms to autonomously play chess against one another. My computer vision system is included within CorrectPosition.m, ProcessImageDisp.m, and ProcessImageRot.m. The remaining functions were written by other lab students.
